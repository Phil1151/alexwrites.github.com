		<h1> Rowan Tree</h1>
		<h4>By Alexander Edgar / Philip Spillane </h4>


<p>
she is rotten?<br><br>

The great magnificent<br>
vanquisher of malevolent foes,<br><br>

like the daemons that haunts your sisters body,<br>
she&#146;s swaying again and she scares you....<br><br>

The Rowan.<br><br>

you remember the blood red berries,<br>
surrounded by serrated leaves.<br><br>

Those September beads of bitter<br>
were perfect for the picking,<br><br>

and you would take fist fulls,<br>
so your sister will stop her crying.<br><br>

stop her whaling,<br>
stop her swaying. <br><br>


Her Gout protruding from her big toe,<br>
and her frightening inhuman whales<br>
of the daemon dragon that lives inside her.<br><br>

You remember the tricks of bowling the berries,<br>
the traditional dances and the secret spells.<br><br>

The pot where in which you bake the jam,<br>
is the most expensive ware inside this,<br>
straw heather mound,<br>
which you call home.<br><br>

The Jelly bitter Rowan Jam<br>
mixed with ham,<br><br>

Is the only thing your sister eats.<br>
She then smiles, a smile that you can only see,<br>
that others just see the Devil inside.<br><br>

Her face blood rudely red,<br>
she only eats with her hands,<br>
like a dog she tears the meat.<br>

You would slowly pat her scruffy hair,<br>
the knots of her rusty main.<br>

What would you do without your scarlet red sister,<br>
and what would she do without you...<br>

The Rowan is now black rotten.<br>
The September morning frost doesnâ€™t make it any better.<br><br>

There&#146;s no berries, just a tree structure<br>
built from ash.<br><br>

... You can&#146;t even produce a tear,<br><br>

your sister won&#146;t eat,<br>
your sister won&#146;t sleep,<br>
she whale more nights,<br>
again and again...<br><br>

because your saviour,<br>
your goddess,<br>
your guarding angle,<br>
for so long is dead.<br><br>

You just stair at the black branches.<br>
What happened in all those months,<br>
that you refused to check<br>
the Rowan?<br><br>

Maybe the God needed protection too,<br>
you just molested its children,<br>
for only your retarded sisters sake.<br><br>

Maybe you should have saved it,<br>
stopped it,<br>
stop the mysterious fire,<br>
that happened all those months of ago...<br><br>

Maybe this is a Gods punishment,<br>
of not thanking the tree,<br>

the absence of symbioses...<br><br>

Suddenly you feel somebody clutch your hand,<br>
and you turn.<br><br>

Little Sister squeezes you tittlie,<br>
and pulls you down to her level.<br>
Puts your hand where her heart beats wildly,<br><br>

Where you suddenly realize that no daemon<br><br>

could ever live inside,<br><br>

because she cares,<br><br>

Where she speaks her rare words...<br><br>

&#147;I am sorry sister&#148;
