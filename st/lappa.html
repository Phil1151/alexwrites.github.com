		<h1> Lappa to Lona</h1>
		<h4>By Alexander Edgar / Philip Spillane </h4>


<p>
	There was a hare who loved the moon.<br>
When it was full silver coin in the sky she danced in its light, <br>
her limbs flexed, open wide like in flight, leaping up into the air so light<br>
and then land curled up. Then she will prick up and jump in the air again<br>
in the Full Moon Light.<br><br>

When is waxed nearly covered by shadow, only half showing still white,<br>
the hare stood on the darkened side,<br>
and pretended to talk to it all night,<br>
as if they were sitting across from each other<br><br>

She&#146;ll tell it stories about what happened during the day, that were both too blinding and too boring.<br><br>

Some nights the moon would melt fully, disappearing to a black full stop,<br>
and the Hare tout the moon had left her and she would get very scared during the day,<br><br>

till night came again and what ever phase it be in she&#146;ll dance in joy.<br><br>

The hares love the moon was beautiful<br>
simple, and desired little less and little more.<br><br>

Till ...<br><br>

In one blinding full moon night,<br>
it was so bright it put the sun to shame,<br>
the oldest Elk watched the hare leap and dance in the dim meadow.<br><br>

He came out to the open, its antlers bathed his head in dim shadow,<br>
but he stood magnificently,  silhouette against the sky,<br>
as he approached the hare, she leaping and circled, weaving into the grass and shrubs.<br>
skidding through the grass and reeds.<br><br>

&#147;Why hare, Who are you dancing with?&#148; said the Elk, his voice so deep and fare.<br>
&#147;The Moon, he’s my love&#148; charmed the Hare.<br>
Elk was stunned, &#147;Surely the Moon does not evan know. He&#146;s so far away, farthest of the lands brothers&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Oh! so he doesn&#146;t know of me?&#148; said the Hair stunned, confused.<br><br>

&#147;No&#148; <br><br>

The hare stopped dancing then, she curled up like a rabbit, her long ears dropped like hair locks and his body shook like she was cold.<br><br>

&#147;But there may be away&#148; said the Elk.<br><br>

The hare ears sprang up again &#147;Yes there is&#148; she snapped, &#147;I&#146;ll climb, I&#146;ll climb up high!&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Excuse me?&#148;<br><br>

The hare rushed off, rushed off, sped away sped away.<br>
Elk had no choice but to wait.<br><br>

The Hare became his sister Squirrel and claimed the highest tree in the land, however it was too small and not evan close to the coin in the sky. He leapt down and became his brother, the snow fox, and claimed the mountain, but still too small, too small, evan if it was colder up there.<br><br>

The devil sun was rising now, dominating the sky with blood colours. The Moon was masked with blue spilt roughly over its spot in the sky. It happened so quickly the poor hair didn&#146;t evan notice, he returned to the meadow, his ears more dropped than ever.
<br><br>
The Elk was still there waiting, really tired, however too patient.<br>
&#147;Climbing high places won&#146;t do, shifting forms won&#146;t help you that way&#148;<br>
<br>
&#147;Then how do I reach the Moon and tell him how I feel&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Only man can reach the Moon&#148;<br><br>



The Hare was stunned, &#147;Become Man, but there world is strange, who ever becomes man does not come back, my father became man and I never saw him again. My uncle became man and I never saw him again&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Its the only way.&#148;<br><br>

So the rabbit hesitated, and tout slowly, &#147;Ok I’ll become man&#148;<br><br>

It evolved slowly into its distant cousin, the human.<br><br>

She stood tall in her new body. She already missed her ears, which were now so small and snug behind brunet long hair.<br><br>

The Elk nodded at the new human form. <br><br>

&#147;Take this, its a nymph head” he handed a necklace with a little fairys head at the end, it seemed to be in deep sleep, &#147;It will guide you through the man’s way of life and hopefully to your Moon&#148;<br><br>

She put the small nymph head necklace around her neck and the miniature head opened its blue eyes immediately.<br><br>

The new human girl left the elk, ready for the human world.<br><br><br>



<br><br><br>

&#147;First you need a home&#148; chimed the nymph head, in a sing song voice in a high octave.<br><br>

The Hare girl travelled to a town, a forest of blocked hollow caves, and the dry muddy ground was so solid it felt like stone. <br><br>

It was early so luckily the Hare Girl found a free apartment above a shop, with a nice cheap fee.<br><br>

&#147;Can I see the Moon now&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Now you need a job&#148; chimed the Nymph Head. <br><br>

It was afternoon, and luckily the Hare Girl found a job in the book shop, selling books. <br><br>

&#147;Can I see the Moon now&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Now you need to work hard&#148; chimed the Nymph Head.<br><br>

Months sped quickly by, and the Hare Girl worked as hard as she could. She sorted books, helped customers, and made sure the place was organised and clean.<br><br>

Every evening, she&#146;ll go to the shop downstairs to buy food, then upstairs and cook dinner in her apartment. Then before she lay on her bed and fall into sleep, she asked, &#147;Can I see the Moon now&#148;<br><br>

&#147;No, you need to the work harder&#148; chimed the Nymph again, it seem to say the same thing every night.<br><br>

So she worked harder in her job.<br><br>

Year came unnoticeably, and on that day a man she new that came in every day asked her to coffee.  Then things got a little hazy. The Hare Girl felt more like a passenger in a humans pocket. A fly spying on a humans life.<br><br>

As Months and Years flew, they became more about this man. He was tall and made her laugh and see things in a new strange light. He was strangely admirable to the Hare Girl and difficult to move from her mind.<br><br>

She began to forget why she asked the silly question every night, &#147;Can I see the Moon now&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Not yet&#148; the voice around her neck would sing and she would wonder where it came from.<br><br>

The man and her got married, brought a new home, had children, and aged together. However the Girl had a tout in her mind that she was doing all of this to get somewhere but she also new she was getting no where.<br><br>

Till one night, her brunet hair now grey and tangled. Her legs were too tired to dance and walk about so she sat in the porch of her home, gazing into the field above the fence.<br>
She slowly eased herself into a dream, a strange dream.<br><br>

About a hair dancing, dancing, in the Moon Light.  A distant cousin she long forgotten.  Then when she woke, she found the full moon, like a giant eye of a long lost friend looking right and her.<br><br>

It was the most beautiful magnificent thing she ever saw.<br>
She took off The Nymph Necklace and found that she could walk again.  Then she realised she could dance again. Then she found that she could leap and flex.<br><br>

She leapt so high, high in the sky, into the circle light of the full moon, through it and onto the other side. <br><br><br><br>
