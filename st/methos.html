	<h1> &#10087;Death of Mythus&#9753;</h1>
		<h4>By Alexander Edgar / Philip Spillane </h4>
	<p>



The nymphs, they want wi-fi,<br>
they want to stuff the copper cables through their tree&#146;s,<br>
and wind it through their water homes.<br>
And be connected to their metallic <br>
plastic machines, to be easily welcomed<br> 
to the new realm of communication.<br>
<br>
All to their mother Gaia&#146;s dismay,<br>
who doesn&#146;t quote get it.<br><br>

However Pan is managing,<br>
and found a new pleasure being a tricking troll<br>
and picking vulnerable neighbours remotely.<br><br>

You see him hunched on a tree, <br>
young goat legs bringing the white display<br>
in suspended kiss distance.<br><br>

And his Pan Pipes have sadly falling from that hight<br>
and now grow dusty<br><br>

It has effecting poets immensely,<br>
the muses no more tickle their intellect.<br><br>

They  hesitate in front of their leaf pages blank.<br>
Feeling the punch of soulless desperation<br>
and the ever lasting writers block.<br><br>

They plea on the virtual notice boards,<br>
for any spark of nymph,<br>
however now are drowning in the new silence of<br>
dis-attention.<br>
Like their sinking in html colour of blue<br><br>

I was clicking on the 61 keys skilfully when <br>
I heard it,<br>
the day when Mythos died.<br><br>

I heard it lodged in-between a<br>
self portrait of green eyed<br>
Aphrodite,<br>

 and Echo screaming in depression,<br>
trying to understand areas in life <br>
that Ive already reached.<br><br>

However this struck meâ€¦<br>
Mythus has died, <br>
that long bearded, dreadlock mad dog.<br>
Who wore tick clothing, and sprouted tales<br>
<br>
in late nights, after a heavy dose of <br>
whiskey.<br><br>

I hushed away human tears,<br>
and replaced them with reason,<br>
should we contact Logus his brother?<br>
<br>

So I phoned him...<br>

He was programming Java at the time, <br>
and I could hear him <br>
slurping fast food Chinese back,<br><br>

and he knew already, <br>
however sounded dull and uncaring,<br>
And slowly clicked himself <br>
back into 500 lines of code.<br><br>
 
Was he hiding feelings?<br>
Or was he reflecting his name sake?<br><br>

But Mythos has dead!!<br>
That should provoke sorrow!<br><br>

At this time I seeked anyone that cared besides myself,<br><br>

I tried Apollo, a faithful artist<br>
poet, writer, medic, and other<br>
bazars that are both unnecessary<br>
and useful.
He was a faithful friend of Mythos,<br><br><br>

&#147;He seemed fine when we chatted on Skype&#148;
He said<br>
&#147;I was teaching him how to play WOW, however warning him about new security hazards.<br>
He didn&#146;t know the new meaning of Trojan Horse,<br>
the silly goose&#148;<br>
And his chuckle purred down the phone...<br>

I felt like I wanted to crack my teeth<br>
over my tone,<br>
It was as if all humanity had died with my friend,<br>
and all care was bled out from vain&#146;s,<br>
and replace with copper wires, pumped full<br>
of electrical impulses of info heavy protocols.<br>

The funeral was on a perfect sunny day.<br>

All who were there, however eyes locked<br>
on miniature flat phones.<br>
(...I was too, but that was beside the point)<br><br>

they all should paying attention.<br>

They all seemed more entertained by<br>
Artimus coming out that she was lesbian<br><br>

I tried to strike up a conversation with Athena,<br>
however she was getting red hot angry,<br>
after someone had abused her blog<br>
with fire insults<br>
on her snarky biased wisdom ways.<br><br>

In a whole, I tried to understand the mythical mess before me...<br><br>

However through all disattention,<br><br>

as the coffin of Mythos sunk into the ground<br><br>

I saw Logus standing in front of it all.<br>
and a sudden flash of a single tear,<br>
curl down his face,<br>
to his lip<br>
and dripped onto his brothers coffin<br><br>


and his face turned stone again <br>
and left.<br>
