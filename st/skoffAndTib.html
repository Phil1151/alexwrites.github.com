		<h1> Skoff and Tibber</h1>
		<h4>By Alexander Edgar / Philip Spillane </h4>

		<p> <br><br>The grey mass of water crashed into the ship, heaving it off corse as best it could.
The thick waves rose up slowly, it looked like a thick rugged hill of grass as it crashed into the starboard, splitting into droplets.<br><br>

However the moaning depressive wind kept the ship on course. It blew into the fiber sales, heaving the boat along, making it go forward to its destination north.<br><br> 

Every creature hid inside, in fear they may be blowing off the edge if they were up deck and into the monstrous sea bellow. All except one, he leant on the danger starboard side. The angry sea pounded his wet fur continuously, so he to shook his head to get most of it off.<br><br>

He was a golding fox called Skoff. His eyes were an amber green and he wore a blue coat that went down to his back paws, which kept him upright like a human. He was worried about the destination he was approaching. he was half hoping, half wishing that the wind will blow him off the ship, into the sea. Hoping the sea would Sallow him up and he’ll die.<br><br>

Yes... death was a comfort, more comfortable than the destination this ship was brining him. However as we all know, the comfort of death can only be felt once.<br><br>

&#147;Come inside, its desperate&#148; he heard, and the golding faced fox gazed down to see a little rabbit curled into a grey ball, near his bottom right paw.<br>
&#147;It&#146;s beautiful&#146; he said with no emotion.<br>
The poor rabbit hesitated and said, &#147;Ma ma... my acquaintance, what ever your opinion you have of the weather, you can&#146;t have your fur in a soaked condition when we reach Heaven.&#148;<br>
<br><br>
The fox laughed. He pulled back his fur from his eyes and said, &#147;Heaven? Why should I care my friend&#148;
Another pause as the rabbit tried to keep his ears from standing, as they were numbly cold. &#147;You have to care!&#148; he finally said, surprised.<br><br>

The fox gazed at a coal black cloud, that seemed to be the darkest of all the hanging massive in the sky. Its giant fluff looked like it was desperate to burst in a second. It looked old and monstrous as the highest wind polled it towards them.<br><br>

He looked down where the rabbit was and found him gone, however he only hat to turn around to find the creature slowly trying to crawl back inside. Keeping in a shape of a grey fur ball as best it could.<br><br>

&#147;What&#146;s your name&#148; said the Fox.<br><br>

The rabbit froze. He poked his soaked head up and said....<br>
&#147;Tibber&#148; <br><br>

&#147;I&#146;m Skoff&#148; he smiled back, &#147;What you die from?&#148;.<br><br>

&#147;Don&#146;t remember strangely. Loads of animals here have told me of their deaths, but I don&#146;t remember mine... is that bad?&#148;<br><br>

&#147;It isn&#146;t for me to say&#148; shrugged the fox.<br><br>

The rabbit walked back towards him, this time upwards with a bit more confidence. “What happened to you.”<br><br>

&#147;An old friend killed me&#148; he answered coldly.<br><br>

&#147;Really?&#148;<br><br>

&#147;He said he was going to do it sometime, didn’t expect him to do it so soon&#148;<br><br>

&#147;That&#146;s awful!&#148; said the rabbit, laying a soft paw on the fox&#146;s knee.<br><br>

He shrugged, &#147;I guess it is.&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Of corse it is, no body ever deserves to be killed!&#148;<br><br>

Suddenly another wall rose from the the sea bed, rising higher than the ship. The fox held onto the bars and the rabbit curled back into a ball as the mass crashed into them boat, soaking them yet again. Surprisingly they remained standing.<br><br>

&#147;Do you remember anything from your life?&#148; Said Scuff, as the wave retreated back home. &#147;I had a family I think, and also think I was journalist... something to do with written anyway.&#148; said the rabbit, standing up again. He began to shiver, his teeth clattering. <br>
&#147;You?&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Too much&#148; was all Scuff answered.<br><br>

&#147;Do you want to talk about it?&#148;<br><br>

&#147;I did awful things Tibber&#148;<br><br>

The rabbit nodded understandingly. &#147;As long as you redeem yourself and know what you did, know the feelings you caused, and see another point of view beyond your own. Then \heaven gates should at least be open for you.&#148;<br><br>

Skoff laughed again.<br><br>

The rabbit stared at his companion, his black eyes pulled a face of deep confusion. “What are you laughing at?”<br><br>

&#147;We been brought to place where racism, regionalism, classism, equality and other prejudice opinions are been brought down on us all. We won’t be treated the same. The sinned remained scarred, and the forgiven would be praised and brought forward to the gates. Ugly but its the only way it can be done.&#148;<br><br>

The rabbit was stunned, &#147;That&#146;s a dark opinion on Heaven? What happens to the sinned?&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Get left behind on this ship, or go to Hell I guess&#148; smiled to fox.<br><br>

The Rabbit was petrified at hearing this. His heart felt like it was stabbed. 
&#147;That&#146;s silly&#148; he finally said, &#147;judgement would be made, but they can&#146;t be that harsh.&#148;<br><br>

&#147;It&#146;s not harsh, its the only way&#148; said the Fox. Not to the Rabbit but to the open sea and the sky and wind ahead of him. 
The Rabbit began to get very worried, &#147;I don&#146;t think I live such a fruitful life actually&#148; he said suddenly, &#147;I think I stole things in my youth, heart my friends, and chose things because of my old selfish way. Would that curse me to Hell?&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Do you fear Hell?&#148; said Scuff looking interestingly down at his companion. <br><br>

&#147;Yes, well&#148; the Rabbit tout deeply then, &#147;Of corse I fear Hell, but if its what I deserve then its rightfully given.&#148;<br><br>

The Fox laughed, &#147;You are puppet on a string&#148; he mumbled.<br>
&#147;What about you then, do you deserve it?&#148;<br><br>

&#147;I was axially hoping that death was an infinity of darkness of no tout, no sound, no words. Instead of waking up in the ship on corse for heaven&#148; answered the beast.<br><br>

A smaller wave lapped up against the edge of the boat, only just reaching them. Its million hands touched and slithered along the floor boards, under the paws of the two animals. They both noticed the storm was easing.<br><br>

&#147;That does not answer my question?&#148; said Tibber.<br><br>

&#147;I deserve to just have bin killed, and only bin killed, and not to witness an after life&#148; the Fox finally answered.<br><br>

There was a minute silence between the two. Only the gush of the wavy sea in the background. <br><br>

&#147;I feel sorry for you then?&#148; said the Rabbit, still confused.<br><br>

&#147;That&#146;s fine&#148; nodded Fox.<br><br>

A trumpet sounded from above. The two looked up as they suddenly noticed the clouds retreating quickly to show a sky blue atmosphere above. The sea flattened into a calmed patient beast.<br>
A sun appeared from no where, to show ahead of them was... land.<br>

It was dessert Island with nothing on it except pail cream sand. An old wooding door lay suspended in the pile, just standing oddly. It looked rotten and old.<br><br>

&#147;Land Ho!!&#148; came a scream from above.<br><br>

The animals all hurried outside and crowded around the small deck of the ship. It was now packed full of Bulls, Cats, Dogs, Dears, Bears, Snakes, Ladybirds, Flys, Bees, Apes, Black Birds, Cows, Chickens, Elephants, Sheep, Goats, Leopards, Lions, Tigers, Canarys, Pigs, Parrots, Donkeys, Ducks, Swans, Horses, Hippopotamuses, Sparrows, Doves, Kingfishers... an endless list of species.<br><br>

The loudness of the crushing waves was now replaced with the loud chatting of every animal that was now on deck. The Fox lay his paws over his ears. <br><br>

A Crow landed and cawed a loud scream that seemed to shut everyone up. <br><br>

&#147;Good day all, I was the captain of your ship, Captain Work Work, I hope you all had a pleasant journey here. Welcome to St Peters. Here is the entrance into the changing room where you can fit into your Human skin and then your brought to Heaven&#148;
<br><br>
&#147;Human skin?&#148; said the Rabbit.<br><br>

&#147;Humans are perfection. They are an image of the creator, and only Mirrors can surround him in Heaven.&#148; said the Fox.<br><br> 

The rabbit hesitated, &#147;Why are you have such crude opinions! We are all equals in heaven.&#148;<br><br>

The Captain cawed again to grab everyone attention again once more, &#147;All creatures most exit the boat immediately. All except Scuff, you most remain on board as you haven&#146;t reached your destination yet.&#148;<br><br>

He was staring right at Scoff and he nodded in deep understanding.<br><br>

All animals great and small rushed out of the boat, piling onto the small wooding plank that was now placed next to the ship, leading to the ground. In speed and excitement.<br><br>

All except the Fox and Rabbit.<br><br>

The Fox shrugged. &#147;You know why you can&#146;t remember how you died...&#148;<br><br>

&#147;Why?&#148; said the Rabbit.<br><br>

&#147;You died a peaceful death, so peacefully you didn&#146;t see it coming&#148; smiled Scoff.<br><br>

The Rabbit smiled, &#147;maybe&#148;<br><br>

He slowly walked onto the plank, &#147;Shall we meet again?&#148;<br><br>

&#147;No. I&#146;m scarred and your clean. I&#146;m cursed and your cured. There&#146;s no way our paths would ever meet again&#148;<br><br>

&#147;We were judged then? You were right&#148; said the Rabbit surprised as he stared at the rusted Door that had now opened and every beast was walking through in single file. They were excited at what was on the other side, and didn’t had a second tout of what they left behind.<br><br>

&#147;Its all Ugly&#148; said Tibber.<br><br>

&#147;But beautiful&#148; said the Fox. <br><br>


&#147;Are you ok mister Tibber?&#148; said the captain, as he was the only passenger left on board apart from the Fox and himself.
<br><br>
The Rabbit scurried down the plank and turned around at the edge on the sand. The plank had vanished and the boat began to move away from the Island. <br><br>

&#147;I forgive you Scuff! What ever you had done! You deserve to be here with me as much as any of us.&#148;
<br><br>
He received no shout back or reply from the ship, as it slowly sailed away from the Island and vanished into the distance. 
The rabbit turned around, and entered Heaven.
